xml_description: Causes the AVPlayer to pause, resume playing, or stop. Once a player
  is stopped, it cannot be set to Playing (because "stopped" gives FileMaker permission
  to get rid of the AVPlayer). Conversely, this step will not work unless the AVPlayer
  was already either playing or paused.
