# FmClipTools

Tools for converting, modifying, and saving FileMaker Pro clipboard objects. Coded in AppleScript (so, macOS only).

Objects that you can copy/paste in FileMaker (Scripts, Script Steps, Fields/Tables in Manage Database, Layout Objects, Custom Functions, Value Lists) are essentially XML data, but stored in the clipboard in such a way that you cannot just paste that XML into a text editor. This project includes scripts to easily convert those objects to/from XML, replace within the clipboard objects, replicate an object in bulk, and much more.
